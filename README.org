EcoRick is a software for raising awareness about ecology and the
world around us.

Users of the app get points based on the recycling and ecology events
that they go to.

For now this is only a prototype and for its deployment it’s needed to
have Node.JS installed. To run the application it’s needed to start
the server using the command from the project director

#+begin_src
npm run development
#+end_src
