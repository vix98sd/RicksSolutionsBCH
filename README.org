EcoRick is a software for raising awerness about ecology and the world
around us.

Users of the app get points based on the recycling and ecology events
that they go on.

For now this is only a prototype and for it's deployment it's needed
to have Node.js installed. To run the application it's needed to start
the server using the command from the project directory:

#+begin_src
npm run development
#+end_src
